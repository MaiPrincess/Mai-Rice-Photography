Project Overview
This project is a basic website designed as part of a tech class. The goal was to create a simple, functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
   
The website includes a home page with a working carousel and a live web cam of one of my favorite places to take pictures, my old stomping grounds... Monterey, California. The gallery has hoverable and clickable photos. The about section that has a count down timer that changes to the closest prime whale watching seasons in Monterey.  It also has 2 different live cameras, one of the bay and one of the sea otters from the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The contact button will take you down to a  clickable email link.  I hope you enjoy my photos, they are just a taste of what I have and what is my passion!
