        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Mai Rice Photography, 
            where we capture the most precious moments in life
            with passion.
        </p>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by cameras.  My family always takes
            pictures, especially at family gatherings.  I can remember trying 
            to use my grandma's camera and wanting to look thru the viewfinder.
            I would try to sneak her camera anytime I could by pushing a chair
            to try to reach where she had it sitting next to her phone.
        </p>
        <p>My dad loved taking pictures and had a really nice Minolta with an
            additional telephoto lens.  I would want to play with it and of course 
            being to young to know any better I would get told no.  He would help me 
            take pictures from time to time and I could not wait to see the pictures.</p>
        <p>When I was in the 3rd grade my dad bought me a small camera to use and learn with.
            I was hooked!  He would attempt to teach me about F stops but I just wanted to take pictures. 
            I would take my camera to school and take pictures of my friends and nature when we would have 
            field trips.</p>
        <p>Eventually, when I was in the 6th grade he let me use his camera for a class trip to the Natural
            Bridges in Santa Cruz.  I used up what I had taken with me that trip and I can still remember 
            the photo album my dad and I put together with the pictures of all the sea life from the tide 
            pools and also of the natural bridges and the ocean pictures.</p>
        <p>I was constantly using his camera. I took it horse back riding one day to a waterfall, where I 
            took so many shots.  After galloping back home, I gave the camera back to my dad and when he had 
            gone to use it found that the mirror inside had broken.  So he had to have it repaired.  He didn't 
            make me pay for it but he explained to me about being careful with cameras.</p>
        <p>I have always had a camera with me ever since then.  In high school I was on the yearbook committee.
            Our teacher taught us how to roll film and how to develop it in our class darkroom.  I always thought 
            that was the coolest thing ever!  I had so much fun doing that.</p>
        <p>Growing up in a small farming community and with my Grandparents, I was not allowed to watch tv. 
            My grandpa called it an idiot box.  So I would play outside. It lead to  my love of being out 
            in nature, when not on the east coast and always hiked, biked and was at the ocean, my favorite 
            place to be as you will see by most of my pictures.  I just hope that by looking at some of these 
            that you can feel the experience the beauty of nature of when I took them.</p>
